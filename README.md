**Project Title:** Project 2: Heat Transfer Rod ‚Äì *Fastest Cooling and Highest Heat Transfer Rate (q)*

## Project Objective

This project investigates which rod geometry‚Äîcylinder, square, or cone‚Äîachieves the highest convective heat transfer rate (`q`) under three conditions:
1. **Free (Natural) Convection**
2. **Forced External Convection**
3. **Forced Internal Convection**

All geometries are constrained to:
- Same **lateral surface area** (~0.005 m¬≤)
- Same **length** (6 inches = 0.1524 m)
- Constant **surface temperature** of 100¬∞C
- Exposed to air or water at 20¬∞C

## üìå Key Concepts

- Empirical Nusselt number correlations from *Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer* were used to compute heat transfer coefficients.
- Cone shape required optimization to maximize volume while maintaining a constant surface area.
- For forced convection, the **Churchill‚ÄìBernstein correlation** was applied.
- For internal flow, **laminar, transitional, or turbulent** Nusselt number equations were used based on Reynolds number.
- Cone was approximated via discretized **cylinders (internal/forced convection)** or **inclined plates (free convection)**.

## üß™ Methods & Tools

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `math`  
- **Optimization:** `scipy.optimize.minimize` to maximize cone volume  
- **CFD (proposed for future work):** ANSYS Fluent for validating cone behavior under flow

## üìä Summary of Results

| Geometry | Free Convection (q) | Forced External Convection (q) | Forced Internal Convection (q) |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Cylinder | 4.42 W              | 21.58 W                        | 4.03 W                         |
| Square   | **4.77 W**          | **24.30 W**                    | **4.18 W**                     |
| Cone     | 2.66 W              | 9.66 W                         | 2.27 W                         |

**Conclusion:** The **square rod** has the highest heat transfer rate in all cases, making it the most efficient geometry for thermal dissipation under the given constraints.
